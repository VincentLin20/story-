# story-
this is a practice assignment 
I am going to a first practice of the CYSO.
CYSO is a symphony band 
Because I got a good grade in my audition, I think I am sitting at the first placae.
I am really nervous. 
Hopefully everything will go good.
After the practice they think I did very well
I'm very happy about that 
I go home and keep practice 
After a few year I try to apply UCLA by music 
Although I did well but I stil fail the test
Everything suck.
